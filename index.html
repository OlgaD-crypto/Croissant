      Today we’re conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If you’re
      about to run away screaming, I understand. I’m not sugarcoating it:
      croissants aren’t easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot of
      rolling. However, just because this recipe is advanced doesn’t mean that
      YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely handle this
      recipe. ♥ <br />Let me hold your hand through the whole process. I’m
      sharing step-by-step photography, a full video tutorial, plenty of tricks
      based on what I’ve learned, and the croissant recipe. I started working on
      croissants earlier this year. I studied a couple recipes, tested them,
      tweaked what I found necessary, and played with this dough for weeks. The
      croissants are golden brown, extra flaky, crisp on the outside, soft on
      the inside, and unbelievable warm from the oven. One bite of this delicate
      French pastry will immediately transport you to a quaint French bakery.
      I’m confident in this homemade croissants recipe and I’m confident in YOU
      baking them.
